This [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module provides a set of compendium packs containing lists of items from the [Comprehensive Price Lists](https://www.lythia.com/game_aides/comprehensive-pricelist/) on [Lythia.com](https://lythia.com/).  The module is organized into a set of compendium packs, each pack contains the inventory items for a particular vendor (Apothecary, Bonecarver, Chandler, Clothier, etc.).

This module is specifically designed to be used with the Foundry VTT [HarnMaster 3](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3/) system; it will probably not work with any other systems.

## Activate the module
After installing, as GM go to the `Manage Modules` options menu in your World Settings tab then enable the `hm3-cpl` module.

## Usage

The compendium packs will show up under `Compendium Packs`, prefaced with "CPL".

Note that due to the large number of compendium packs provided by this module, it may be desirable to enable this module only when you need to access the pricelists. In that case, after activating the module access the desired pricelist, copy the items you need, and then disable the module.

# Credits

Many thanks to Scythen for creating the CPL and assisting in generating this module based on those lists.
